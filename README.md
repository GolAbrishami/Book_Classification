# Book_Classification
Classifying books based on their ratings

### Objective 

Our project will hopefully show ways in which county library members can share their interested books to members who have similar taste of books, in a way of enhancing communication and reading culture. 

### Dataset

For our goal, We have combinaed three related datasets.

### Methods

We used: 

1. KNN
2. K_Means
3. Hierarchical Clustering
 
### Outcome

With our clustering model, when new users come, we can derive which cluster they belong to by asking them to rate these 10 books, and thus, give them fairly good recommendation about books and future events information.<br>
From our clustering model, we could observe existing users' interest. Most of the users like fictions (such as *To Kill a Mockingbird*, *Animal Farm*, and *The Great Gatsby*) and rated them high. Few people like books related to life science or historical topic. <br>
In this case, it would be a good idea for the librarians to organize weekly/ monthly book events related to fictions since the result has shown majority users have great interested in this genre. A booklist of new fictions, science or history books could be printed out as flyers at the front desk for reference and recommendations.
